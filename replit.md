# ZATCA Data Owner Agent

## Overview

This is an AI-powered data governance assistant called the **ZATCA Data Owner Agent**. It helps data owners, data stewards, and data governance professionals with:

- **Data Classification** — Classify data fields per Saudi SDAIA NDMO standards (Top Secret, Secret, Confidential, Restricted, Public)
- **Business Definitions** — Generate clear definitions for data fields/elements
- **Data Quality Rules** — Suggest quality rules across dimensions (completeness, accuracy, consistency, etc.)
- **Analytical Data Model** — Design star schema / dimensional models with interactive SVG diagram, PNG export, and DDL generation

Users interact through a chat interface. They can type prompts or upload Excel files containing data fields, and the AI returns structured, formatted analysis.

### Chat Display Rules
- The chat panel is for conversation summaries only, not data output
- When the AI completes any analysis, the chat bubble shows a short 2-3 line summary (e.g. "✅ Business definitions generated for 28 fields. Results saved to result.xlsx — Sheet: business_definitions")
- All actual results (tables, field lists, definitions, classifications, rules) go exclusively into result.xlsx as properly formatted sheets
- Chat bubbles never render markdown tables, long lists, or raw data output for analysis results
- Non-analysis conversational responses render normally with markdown
- A ZATCA blue (#0094D3) "Download result.xlsx" button appears below each summary message
- summaryOverrides state tracks which message IDs should show summaries vs full content
- When switching conversations, existing messages are re-scanned to populate summaryOverrides
- User messages strip Excel file content via `stripExcelContent()` — only the user's prompt text and a file attachment indicator are shown; raw parsed Excel data is never displayed in the UI
- Multi-analysis requests are supported: system prompt instructs Claude to output all requested tables in one response; frontend parser extracts all tables independently

### Collapsible Thread Blocks
- Messages are grouped into user+assistant pairs ("threads") via `groupMessagesIntoThreads()`
- Each thread has a styled header bar with: ZATCA green (#067647) left border, light grey background, chevron icon, 60-char message preview, timestamp, and analysis type badge
- Threads are expanded by default; clicking the header toggles collapse (conditional rendering)
- `collapsedThreads` state (Set of indices) tracks collapsed threads
- Global "Collapse All" / "Expand All" buttons appear in the header when there are 2+ threads
- Analysis type detected from keywords: "business definition" → Business Definitions, "classification" → Data Classification, "quality" → Data Quality Rules, "data model"/"star schema" → Data Model
- Streaming thread is always expanded and shows a loading indicator

### Sidebar Session Management
- Sidebar and chat pane are resizable using `react-resizable-panels` (PanelGroup with horizontal direction, autoSaveId="chat-layout")
- Sidebar can be collapsed/expanded via PanelLeftClose/PanelLeftOpen toggle buttons; when collapsed, the sidebar Panel and resize handle are conditionally unmounted
- Each conversation shows a trash icon on hover; clicking shows inline "Delete this session?" confirmation with "Yes, Delete" / "Cancel"
- `deletingConvId` state tracks which conversation is showing confirmation; `fadingOutConvId` triggers 150ms fade-out animation before deletion
- "Clear All Sessions" button at sidebar bottom (muted red) with inline confirmation ("This will delete all sessions. Are you sure?")
- `DELETE /api/conversations/all` endpoint deletes all messages then all conversations
- If the active conversation is deleted, auto-navigates to new empty session
- Both delete mutations use `onSettled` to always reset UI state on success or failure

### Cumulative result.xlsx Feature
- Maintains an in-memory cumulative data structure (`ResultRow[]`) keyed by `field_name` across multiple AI analyses
- After each AI response, `detectAndExtractAllAnalyses()` scans all markdown tables for analysis-specific headers and extracts field data
- Supports multiple analysis types in a single response (each table detected independently)
- Data Quality rules support multi-row per field (multiple DQ dimensions/rules per field preserved)
- Generates separate sheets per analysis type: business_definitions, data_classification, data_quality_rules
- Non-DQ sheets (business_definitions, data_classification) are deduplicated by field_name in `generateResultExcel()` to prevent duplicate rows caused by DQ multi-row merging
- Result banner appears above the input area when results exist, with ZATCA blue download button
- Header bar also shows a compact download button when results exist
- Analytical Data Model: when Claude returns a JSON block with fact_tables/dimension_tables/relationships, it's detected by `detectDataModelJSON()`, stored in `dataModel` state, and rendered as an interactive SVG diagram via `DataModelDiagram` component. Adds 3 sheets to result.xlsx: data_model_fields, data_model_relationships, data_model_ddl
- PII & Sensitive Data Detection: when Claude returns a JSON block with scan_summary/columns, it's detected by `detectPiiScanJSON()`, stored in `piiScans` (per-message) and `latestPiiScan` state. Chat shows summary-only with risk badge (🔴/🟡/🟢). Adds `pii_scan` sheet to result.xlsx with columns: column_name, detected_data_type, is_pii, is_sensitive, pii_category, pdpl_relevance, risk_level, recommendation, suggested_control
- `dataModelMessageIds` (Set) tracks which assistant messages contain data models so the diagram renders on re-visit
- File-reset confirmation dialog (AlertDialog) appears when uploading a new file while results already exist
- Session state (results, field names, file name, summaryOverrides) resets on: new chat, conversation switch, conversation delete, or confirmed file reset
- Server sends `fieldNames` SSE event when an Excel file is uploaded, allowing the frontend to track session fields
- System prompt instructs Claude to always include structured summary tables with exact column headers per analysis type

### Data Insights Report
- Standalone feature triggered by keywords like "give me insights", "analyze this data", etc. when an Excel file with data rows is uploaded
- Backend (`routes.ts`): `profileExcelData()` computes per-column statistics (type, nulls, unique count, min/max/mean/median/stddev for numeric, top 5 for text, date range for dates); `INSIGHTS_SYSTEM_PROMPT` instructs Claude to return structured JSON with report_title, dataset_summary, key_insights, column_profiles, recommendations, data_quality_flags
- Backend sends `{ insightsMode: true }` SSE event before streaming so frontend knows to expect insights JSON
- Frontend (`insights-store.ts`): `detectInsightsJSON()` detects the insights JSON, `generateInsightsExcel()` creates a styled `insights_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.xlsx` with 5 sheets (executive_summary, key_insights, column_profiles, recommendations, data_quality_flags), `getInsightsScorecard()` extracts scorecard values
- Chat shows compact summary text + 2x2 scorecard grid (Total Insights, High Impact, Anomalies, Completeness) + dark blue download button
- Insights reports are completely separate from result.xlsx — each generates its own timestamped file
- `insightsReports` array in state stores all reports for the session; `insightsForMessage` maps message IDs to reports for re-hydration
- Previous reports list shown below download button when multiple reports exist in the session

### Multi-Language Support (Arabic / English)
- `lang` state (`"en" | "ar"`) toggles between English (LTR) and Arabic (RTL)
- Globe icon toggle button in the top header bar shows "EN" or "AR"
- `translations` object at top of chat.tsx contains all static UI strings in both languages
- `dir="rtl"` / `dir="ltr"` set on root container for RTL layout switching
- Thread header borders flip between `borderLeft` and `borderRight` based on language
- Feature card text alignment, streaming cursor margin, and message bubble alignment are conditionally mirrored
- `detectAnalysisTag()` returns translated tag labels
- `DataModelDiagram` accepts `lang` prop and translates legend/button labels via `diagramTranslations`
- AI responses are NOT translated — they remain in whatever language Claude responds in
- Language preference persists in React state for the session (not across sessions)

## System Architecture

### Frontend (React + Vite)
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript, bundled by Vite
- **Routing**: Wouter — single route at `/` renders the `ChatPage`
- **State & Data Fetching**: TanStack React Query for server state; React `useState`/`useRef` for local UI state
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui built on Radix UI primitives, styled with Tailwind CSS
- **Markdown Rendering**: `react-markdown` for non-analysis responses only
- **Table Utilities**: `client/src/lib/table-utils.ts` — parses markdown tables for data extraction
- **Excel Export**: `xlsx` (SheetJS) library for client-side `.xlsx` file generation
- **Font**: Open Sans (primary), Fira Code (mono)

### Backend (Express + Node.js)
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript, run via `tsx` in development
- **Entry**: `server/index.ts` creates an HTTP server and registers routes
- **Routes**: `server/routes.ts` delegates to `server/replit_integrations/chat/routes.ts`
- **File Uploads**: `multer` handles Excel file uploads (in-memory, max 10MB), parsed with `xlsx`

### Chat System (`server/replit_integrations/chat/`)
- **`routes.ts`**: REST endpoints for conversations and messages. Parses uploaded Excel files. Uses Anthropic streaming API (SSE).
- **`storage.ts`**: Database abstraction (`IChatStorage`) using Drizzle ORM
- **`index.ts`**: Re-exports routes and storage

### Data Layer
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Neon (serverless)
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM — tables: `conversations`, `messages`
- **Schema**: `shared/models/chat.ts`, re-exported from `shared/schema.ts`
- **Validation**: `drizzle-zod` for Zod schema generation
